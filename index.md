# Aarav Jain - Image Recognition with Raspberry Pi
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:
```HTML 
<!--- This is an HTML comment in Markdown -->
<!--- Anything between these symbols will not render on the published site -->
```

# First Milestone : Simple Image Detection Using OpenCV

First, I assembled my Raspberry Pi into its case, wired up its fan, and connected the ArduCam. Then I opened the terminal and expanded the necessary libraries for image recognition. The two most significant libraries were Tensorflow Lite and OpenCV. TensorFlow is open-source software for machine learning and artificial intelligence, but I installed TensorFlow Lite as it was more compatible with smaller Edge devices such as my Raspberry Pi 4B. After installing everything, I could complete a simple image detection using OpenCV. This preliminary code will take in an image as an input and output the image with a box around the desired object we want to detect, which is a sign.

# First milestone code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
# Second milestone code
goober.

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
# Third milestone code
goober.
```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
